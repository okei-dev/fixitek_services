    text: "I was nervous about finding someone trustworthy to fix my AC, but Fixitek made the whole experience stress-free. Booking online was simple, the technician showed up right on time, and within an hour everything was working perfectly again. What stood out most was how polite and knowledgeable the expert was — they even gave me tips to keep the unit running longer. Definitely my go-to from now on.",

    text: "Fixitek saved my weekend! My washing machine broke down the night before family came over, and I was panicking. I booked through the app late at night, and by the next morning, a professional was at my door. The repair was quick, the pricing was fair, and the service was friendly. It’s rare to find fast and reliable help these days, but Fixitek really delivered.",

    text: "What impressed me most about Fixitek was the professionalism. From the moment I booked, I got clear updates and reminders. The technician came prepared, diagnosed the issue immediately, and had the right tools and parts with them. I didn’t feel like I was being upsold or rushed — just honest, efficient service. It felt like working with someone who genuinely cared about solving my problem.",

    text: "I had tried other services before, but nothing compared to Fixitek. My fridge was leaking, and past repair companies had given me vague answers and long wait times. With Fixitek, I got a clear timeline, transparent pricing, and a technician who actually explained what went wrong in plain English. I could tell they were true experts. The repair has held up perfectly, and I’ll never go back to guessing who to trust.",

    text: "Fixitek turned a stressful situation into an easy one. My kitchen sink was clogged the night before a dinner party, and I thought I’d have to cancel. I booked on Fixitek, and within hours, a friendly expert was at my home. Not only did they fix it quickly, but they also cleaned up afterward and left everything spotless. That attention to detail really showed me they care about their customers.",
